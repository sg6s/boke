Hello, I'm Yunhai ([sg6s](https://github.com/sg6s)), a middle-aged man with a basic understanding of computer science and technology. I once thought I was proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, but I've come to realize that I've been replaced by younger workers and AI. Currently, I'm exploring ways to make money and gradually turning my technical and development skills into hobbies and auxiliary tools.
